# Description

This mod is for the DLC, it removes the spacing required between buildings so you can stick them all on a neat pile.
It makes it much easier to build a defensible base.
Make sure however: Keep your DOCKING stations CLEAR so the AI doesn't get confused!

Very special thanks to MartinC for his collaboration on this one. (read as: He wrote the code while I putzed around failing miserably)


# Installing
Simply grab the .dll from the release and stick it into steam\steamapps\common\Star Valor\BepInEx\plugins folder. You'll have to install BepInEx first if you haven't already though.
